## Prototyping
_all is talk until the prototype exists_
---
## What is a prototype?
---
A prototype involves making something, crafting an artifact or experience.
---
## What a prototype is not
A prototype is not the final product: it doesn't look like it, it doesn't work like it, the prototype is not meant to be, embody or even represent the final design.
---
## What a prototype is not
A prototype is not a maquette nor a scale model or an illustration.
---
## What a prototype is not
A prototype is not static. It has a high degree of interactivity.
---
### Visualization ≠ Prototype
- A click-through of a website without the actual content is a model or visualization, rather than a prototype
- A maquette is a model
- Visualizations are an important element in the designer's toolkit, but they are not prototypes
---
The purpose of a prototype is to test out a process, an artifact, a concept, an experience or an interaction.
---
A prototype allows you to conduct user research and iterate within your process

James Dyson made 5127 prototypes of his vacuum cleaner before he was satisfied that he’d gotten it right
---
A prototype is a real thing that serves a real purpose
---
### My favorite definition
A prototype is a piece of the future. It brings an element of the future into our present, so that we can discover the impact it will have.
_(this has technical, ethical and managerial consequences)_
---
If your project has an aspect that you don't know how to do, that's what you should prototype first.
---
If you think that something in your project might not work, prototype that too.
---
A prototype may or may not encompass all aspects of a project. Sometimes you only need to prototype certain aspects of your project, other times you need to prototype the entire design.
---
## A prototype has special powers
Its capacity of bringing a piece of the future into the present can be regarded as giving the prototype almost a magical quality. It allows us to discuss a future that we are the first to see.
---
### A prototype let's you think with your hands
---
### A prototype answers questions
like for example
---
#### A prototype responds for its own **viability**
this means that it tackles the toughest aspect of your project FIRST. So that you can answer the most basic question.

_can this design be carried out?_
---
A prototype should allow us to ask practical questions such as:
- how will we make the final product?
- how can we make it fit into the projected footprint?
- how can we make 3,000 of these? and 300,000? and 5 million?
- how do people use this design? or how do people experience this design?
- does this design address the users needs and wants?
- what other purposes can this design be used for?
- in what ways can this design go wrong?
- how do we encourage or discourage unintended uses?
- can it be made safe, secure, vandal-proof, waterproof, etc.?
- does this design degrade gracefully?
---
A prototype, because of its quality of bringing the future into the present,
also lets us ask ethical questions such as:
- who can and cannot use this product?
- who are we leaving out with this design?
- who benefits directly from this design?
- who makes profit from it and from whom is that profit made?
- what people/forms of labor are displaced by the presence of this product/design?
- how does this design alter the world as we know it?
- can it be repaired?
- what is the most immediate impact that this prototype can have?
- what can we predict about the future from that impact?
- how can we present these speculative thoughts without raising unreasonable expectations?
- how does the supply-side of the materials used for this design deal with their own ethical questions?
- what happens to this product when it reaches its end of life?
